# Asteroid_Intercept_Project
Here you can find my Mechatronics Rocket Modelling and Control Project files

Milestone 1 involved modeling the rocket in order to determine its dynamics using the manipulator equation. It also involved determining the asteroid's drag coefficient from simulation data.

Milestone 2 involved designing a controller to allow the rocket to track the asteroid as it hurtles towards a city. A simpler variant of proportional navigation was also used to increase tracking functionality (can be seen in the AsteroidImpact.slx file as a MATLAB function block).
